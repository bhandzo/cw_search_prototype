Without hesitation, he dove right into our challenges and came up with tangible/realistic/proven solutions for us to work on. Everything we wanted and more out of the conversations. Within the first session we discussed multiple ways in which we could address our initial goals. We then spent the next two sessions going into more detail on how we can strategically implement what is best for us as a growing SaaS solution. Given our needs and Mor's approach, I'm searching for and cannot find constructive feedback to provide - he was friendly, prompt, to-the-point, and showed a genuine interest in our success. I could not ask for anything more within our limited mentor/mentee capacity. Thanks so much for recommending Mor to us.\"",
